# Health MBeans

Its very handy to add health checks to Java code running in a JVM and exposing those health checks over JMX. e.g. see the [dropwizard notes](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/getting-started/#creating-a-health-check).

This document outlines a Health check MBean convention that if folks adopt its then easier to discover and will be included in the Console's Health tab.

## Health MBean Convention

Create at least one MBean and register it with a JMX ObjectName including **Type=Health**.

For example an ObjectName could be

    org.apache.activemq:BrokerName=localhost,Type=Health

The MBean should then have these methods

* health() which returns a JMX compliant data structure such as tabular or composite data
* heathList() which returns a List<Object> for use by tools like Jolokia that marshall objects nicely to JSON to avoid JMX's marshalling pain.

Each health status object should include the following properties...

* code = the unique code of the kind of warning/error/issue. We can then use this unique kind ID to generate useful UI tooling & descriptions. Ideally the code should be fully qualified in the same way as Java classes, such as org.apache.activemq.destination.NoConsumer
* resource = the JMX ObjectName of the thing causing the issue
