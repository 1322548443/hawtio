# Fuse Console

A web based console for working with [Fuse](http://fuse.fusesource.org/).

## Trying out the console from Maven

From a git clone you should be able to run the sample web console as follows:

    cd web-console
    mvn test-compile exec:java
    open http://localhost:8080/

That should run a little sample web application with some ActiveMQ and Camel inside to interact with.

A good MBean for real time values and charts is java.lang/OperatingSystem or try looking at queues or camel routes. Notice that as you change selections in the tree the list of tabs aavailable changes dynamically based onthe content.

## Working on the source the code

We love contributions! If you want to hack on the source code here's now to build it...

You'll need to install [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) first...

### Installing typescript

To install [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) you first need to install [npm](https://npmjs.org/) e.g. by [installing nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)

Then you should be able to run:

    npm install -g typescript

### Building with TypeScript

There is a handy shell script [compileTS](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/compileTS) which wraps up using the _tsc_ command to compile the [TypeScipt *.ts files](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/tree/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js) into the [webapp/js/app.js file](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js/app.js)

    cd web-console
    ./compileTS

By default this then generates the [webapp/js/app.js file](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js/app.js) and it then watches for changes to the source files and auto-recompiles on the fly.

## Building with GruntJS

Another build option is [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/). Again to build the code with gruntjs you will need to install [npm](https://npmjs.org/) e.g. by [installing nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)

Then to install grunt:

    npm install -g grunt

Then in the web-console directory you will need to install the grunt plugins required

    cd web/web-console
    npm install grunt-type

### Incremental compile with GruntJS

Its a simple matter of running 'grunt' :) By default this then watches for changes to the source files and auto-recompiles on the fly

    grunt

## Technology overview

For those interested in contributing, here is a low down of the various open source libraries used to build Fuse Console.

* [jolokia](http://jolokia.org/) is the server side / JVM plugin for exposing JMX as JSON over HTTP. Its awesome and is currently the only server side component of Fuse Console.
* [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) is the language used to implement the console; it compiles to JavaScript and adds classes, modules, type inference & type checking. We recommend [IntelliJ IDEA EAP 12 or later](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/IDEADEV/IDEA+12+EAP) for editing TypeScript - especially if you don't use Windows or Visual Studio (though there is a Sublime Text plugin too).
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) is the web framework for performing real time 2 way binding of HTML to the model of the UI using simple declarative attributes in the HTML.
* [d3](http://d3js.org/) is the visualisation library used to do the force layout graphs (for example the diagram view for ActiveMQ)
* [cubism](http://square.github.com/cubism/) implements the real time horizon charts
* [dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) for graphviz style layouts of d3 diagrams (e.g. the Camel diagram view).
* [DataTables](http://datatables.net/) for sorted/filtered tables
* [DynaTree](http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html) for tree widget
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) small bits of general DOM stuff, usually when working with 3rd party libraries which don't use AngularJS
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for CSS

### Developer References

If you are interested in working on the code the following references and articles have been really useful so far:

## Code walkthrough

If you fancy contributing - and **we love contributions!** the following should give you an overview of how the code hangs together.

* Fuse Console is a single page web appplication, from [this single page of HTML](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/index.html)
* we use [AngularJS routing](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngView) to display different [partial pages](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/tree/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/partials) depending on which tab/view you choose. You'll notice that the partials are simple HTML fragments which use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) attributes (starting with **ng-**) along with some {{expressions}} in the markup.
* other than the JavaScript libraries listed above which live in [webapp/lib](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/tree/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/lib) and are [included in the index.html](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/index.html), we then implement [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) controllers using [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/). All the typescript source is in the [webapp/js directory](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/tree/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js) which is then compiled into the [webapp/js/app.js file](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js/app.js)
* to be able to compile with TypeScript we need to use the various [TypeScript definition files](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/tree/master/web-console/src/main/d.ts) to define the optionally statically typed APIs for the various APIs we use
* the controllers use the [Jolokia JavaScript API](http://jolokia.org/reference/html/clients.html#client-javascript) to interact with the server side JMX mbeans

## Developer Tools

The following are recommended if you want to contribute to the code

* [IntelliJ IDEA EAP 12 or later](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/IDEADEV/IDEA+12+EAP) as this has TypeScript support and is the daddy of IDEs!
* [AngularJS plugin for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk) which is handy for visualising scopes and performance testing etc.
* [JSONView plugin for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) makes it easy to visualise JSON returned by the [REST API of Jolokia](http://jolokia.org/reference/html/protocol.html)
* [Apache Maven 3.0.3 or later](http://maven.apache.org/)
* [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/) - see nearly the beginning of this document for details of how to install and use.

We recommend you enable [Source Maps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit?pli=1) in your browser (e.g. in Chrome) for easier debugging by clicking on the bottom right Settings icon in *JavaScript Console* and [enabling Source Maps support such as in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xJl22Kvgjg)

To help IDEA navigate to functions in your source & to avoid noise; you may want to ignore some JavaScript files in IDEA so that they are not included in the navigation. Go to Settings/Preferences -> File Types -> Ignore files then add these patterns to the end; which will let IDEA ignore the minified verisons of the libraries

    *.min.js;*-min.js

Then select the generated [webapp/js/app.js file](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js/app.js) in the Project explorer, right click and select _Mark as Plain Text_ so that it is ignored as being JavaScript source. This hint came from [this forum thread](http://devnet.jetbrains.net/message/5472690#5472690), hopefully there will be a nicer way to do all this one day!

### Handy AngularJS debugging tip

* open the JavaScript console and select the _Console_ tab so you can type expressions into the shell.
* select part of the DOM of the scope you want to investigate
* right click and select _Inspect Element_
* now in the console type the following

    s = angular.element($0).scope()

You have now defined a variable called _s_ which contains all the values in the active AngularJS scope so you can navigate into the scope and inspect values or invoke functions in the REPL etc.


## How the tabs work

The UI updates in real time based on selections in the JMX tree; so tabs become visible or hide based on the selection.

The nav bar shows/hides based on the *validSelection()* function calls in the [index.html in the ng-show attributes](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/index.html#L39). See the [angularjs ng-show documentation for more detail](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngShow).

The validSelection("someUriPath") function calls on *$scope* calls the same [validSelection on the Workspace class](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js/workspace.ts#L75) which uses this underlying [map of uri path -> validation functions](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js/workspace.ts#L25)

### How to add a new tab

The following gives you an overview of how to add a new kind of tab:

* add the new URI path to [app.ts in the angularjs route definition](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js/app.ts#L4)

    when("/myURI", {templateUrl: 'partials/myNewThing.html', controller: MyNewController}).

* if the tab only applies to certain selections, add an entry to the [uriValidations map of uri paths to validation functions](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js/workspace.ts#L25)

    "myURI": () => this.isMyKindOfThing()

* add an entry to the [index.html nav bar](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/index.html#L39) so the new tab appears

* create your new partial HTML view (myNewThing.html in the [partials directory](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/tree/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/partials)).

* create your new controller, MyNewController.ts in the [js directory](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/blob/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/js/)

## Happy MBeans

Fuse Console looks for happy mbeans which are mbeans that provide a happy status for a component or service.

Some tips on writing a happy mbean...

* use Type=Status in the ObjectName
* have a method statusList() which returns a List of status events - you can have status() return the official JMX Tabular/composite data if you like. Jolokia prefers to get nice JSON from a list of beans though.
* the status beans should have these properties
  * kind = the unique code of the kind of warning/error/issue. We can then use this unique kind ID to generate useful UI tooling & descriptions
  * resource = the JMX ObjectName of the thing causing the issue
