# Fuse Web Console

The Fuse Web Console provides a web based console for working with [Fuse](http://fuse.fusesource.org/)

## Trying out the console from Maven

From a git clone you should be able to run the sample web console as follows:

    cd web-console
    mvn test-compile exec:java
    open http://localhost:8080/

That should run a little sample web application with some ActiveMQ and Camel inside to interact with.

A good MBean for real time values and charts is java.lang/OperatingSystem or try looking at queues or camel routes. Notice that as you change selections in the tree the list of tabs aavailable changes dynamically based onthe content.

## Building with GruntJS

When developing the console, the most RAD tool for building the client side is [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/). We use it to automatically compile the [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) [source code](https://github.com/fusesource/fuse-console/tree/master/web-console/src/main/webapp/ts) for the web console into JavaScript for RAD development.

### Installing GruntJS

To build the code with gruntjs you will need to install [npm](https://npmjs.org/) e.g. by [installing nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)

Then to install grunt:

    npm install -g grunt

Then in the web-console directory you will need to install the grunt plugins required

    cd web/web-console
    npm install grunt-type

### Building with GruntJS

Its a simple matter of running 'grunt' :) By default this then watches for changes to the source files and auto-recompiles on the fly

    grunt

## Technology overview

For those interested in contributing, here is a low down of the various open source libraries used to build Fuse Console.

* [jolokia](http://jolokia.org/) is the server side / JVM plugin for exposing JMX as JSON over HTTP. Its awesome and is currently the only server side component of Fuse Console.
* [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) is the language used to implement the console; it compiles to JavaScript and adds classes, modules, type inference & type checking
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) is the web framework for performing real time 2 way binding of HTML to the model of the UI using simple declarative attributes in the HTML.
* [d3](http://d3js.org/) is the visualisation library used to do the force layout graphs (for example the diagram view for ActiveMQ)
* [cubism](http://square.github.com/cubism/) implements the real time charts
* [dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) for graphviz style layouts of d3 diagrams (e.g. the Camel diagram view).
* [DataTables](http://datatables.net/) for sorted/filtered tables
* [DynaTree](http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html) for tree widget
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) small bits of general DOM stuff, usually when working with 3rd party libraries which don't use AngularJS
