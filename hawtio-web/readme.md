* The war can now be built with:

mvn clean install

node_modules for grunt-type, grunt-contrib-copy and grunt-reload are already available, it might be necessary to do:

npm install -g typescript

to get typescript installed first if setting up a new machine.


* Install the war into karaf/fuse-fabric/fuse-esb with:

osgi:install -s mvn:io.hawt/hawtio-web/1.0/war

You can also run:

log:set DEBUG hawt.io

to see files served out, by default they'll come from the war file as expected.


* To then build the exploded war and watch for changed files:

mvn clean compile war:exploded bundle:manifest package -Pwatch


* To then have the servlet pick up changes to the war edit hawt.io.web.cfg appropriately
and then:

cp hawt.io.web.cfg /path/to/karaf/etc/dir

Current contents of the .cfg file assume you've checked out the "fuse" github project and
have it in the same root directory as the hawtio source tree, and you're copying the cfg file
to the "etc" directory of an untar'd fuse-fabric distro under fabric/fuse-fabric/target.


* Live reload works too, get the extension:

for chrome:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei

The "-Pwatch" profile now triggers the grunt reload task whenver a file is updated, so you
just have to direct your browser to:

http://localhost:35729/sample

and make sure the LiveReload extension is enabled.  Then whenver you make a change the browser
is updated automatically.
