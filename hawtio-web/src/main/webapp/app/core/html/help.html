      <p><a href="http://hawt.io/">hawtio</a> helps you look inside any JVM via JMX along with having plugins for working with
        <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/">Apache ActiveMQ</a>, <a
              href="http://camel.apache.org/">Camel</a>, <a href="http://karaf.apache.org/">Karaf</a>,
        OSGi and <a href="http://fuse.fusesource.org/fabric/">Fuse Fabric</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Click on the navigation bar at the top of this screen to switch between the various plugins available</p>

      <p>As you select different items in trees and tabs you will notice the list of available tabs on the top right of the screen changes.</p>

      <p>You can connect to a different JVM via its Jolokia URL via the <a href="#/preferences">Preferences</a> tab</p>

      <p>For more help please select the next tabs above.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane well" title="ActiveMQ" value="activemq">
      <p>Click <a ng-href="#/jmx/attributes?tab=messaging">Messaging</a> in the top navigation bar
        to see the ActiveMQ specific plugin. (The Messaging tab won't appear if there is no broker in this JVM).</p>

      <p>You can then click on the <b>Queue</b> node to see the queues and <b>Topic</b>
        to see the topics. From either of these nodes you should see a <b>Create Queue</b> or <b>Create Topic</b> tabs to
        be able to create new destinations.</p>

      <p>Once you have selected a destination you should be able to <b>Send</b> to it, <b>Browse</b> a queue or view the
        <b>Attributes</b> or <b>Charts</b></p>

      <p>You can also see a graphical view of all producers, destinations and consumers for all queues (or if you select
        a Topic folder then topics) using the <b>Diagram</b> tab. Selecting a single queue or topic shows just all the
        producers and consumers on that destination. This diagram makes it easy to spot if producers are sending
        messages when there are no consumers, or that consumers are on the wrong destination etc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane well" title="Camel" value="camel">
      <p>Click <a ng-href="#/jmx/attributes?tab=integration">Integration</a> in the top navigation bar
        to view all the running Camel Contexts in the current JVM. (The selection will not appear on the navigation bar if there is no Camel running).</p>

      <p>If you select a CamelContext, Route or Endpoint you can then view the <b>Attributes</b> or <b>Charts</b> of the
        various underlying MBeans.</p>

      <p>You can use the <b>Diagram</b> tab to view a graphical representation of the running routes along with real time runtime metrics.
        If you select a single route instance then the diagram just shows that route only.</p>

      <p>If you select a <b>Route</b> you can then use the <b>Trace</b> tab to perform diagnstic tracing of routes; to see every version of each message
      as it flows around a route.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane well" title="JVM" value="jvm">
      <p>Click <a ng-href="#/jmx/attributes">JMX</a> in the top navigation bar to view the various MBeans available.</p>

      <p>Once you select an MBean in the JMX tree you should then see various tabs on the right of the tree such as <b>Attributes</b>, <b>Charts</b> or <b>Operations</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Click on the <a href="#/logs">Logs</a> tab to be able to view and search the JVM's logging files (for slf4l and log4j).
